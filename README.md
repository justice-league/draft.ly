The intention of this repository is to keep track of all of our code needed to bootstrap a web service that supports the following features:

Stores meta information of beers on tap

A web service that allows one to query where certain beers are available on tap

Potential users of this web service will start off being websites that can render this information on desktop browsers as well as mobile/tablet browsers and eventually migrate to native mobile/tablet apps.
